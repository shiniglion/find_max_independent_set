# find_max_independent_set
This program provides a polynomial time heurist approach to find a max independent set

Input Format.
The first line of each case containes two numbers: Vnum and Enum, where Vnum and Enum are the number of vertices and edges of a graph.
The following Enum lines describe the edge of this graph.
Each line has two numbers v1 and v2 which tell that there is an undirected edge between v1 and v2.
